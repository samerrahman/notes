# 3.1 Homogenous Eq with Constant Coefficients 


$$
\frac{d^{2}y}{dt^{2}} = f(t,y, \frac{dy}{dt})
$$

generally

$$
f(t)y'' + p(t) y' + q(t) y = g(t) 
$$

Constant Coefficients, meaning let 

$$
f(t), p(t), q(t) 
$$ 

are constants 

and make

$$
g(t) = 0
$$

so this will break down to 

$$
ay'' + by' + cy = 0
$$

this is what we call a type one second order diffeq

For a general Solution, let 

$$
\begin{matrix}
y= e^{rt} \\
y' = re^rt \\
y'' = r^2 e^{rt}
\end{matrix}
$$

giving

$$
(ar^2 + br + c) e^{rt} = 0 
$$

$$
ar^2 + br+c = 0
$$ 

this is called the characteristic equation

we can find $$r_1$$, $$r_2$$

plugging these back into y

$$
 \quad
$$

General Solution: 

$$ 
y = C_1e^{r_1t} + C_2e^{r_2t}
$$
with two initial conditions and $$ r_1 \neq r_2 $$

To solve for $$C_1$$ and $$C_2$$, write out two equations with the initial conditions.
