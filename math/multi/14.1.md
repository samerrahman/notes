Defn:

$$
F(x,y) \text{ is a function of two variables } (x,y) \in D
$$

$$
z = F(x,y), \quad z \to \text{dependent variable} \quad z = F(x,y) \in range
$$

EX:

$$
z = F(x,y) = \frac{\sqrt{ y-x^{2} }}{1-x^{2}}
$$
$$
x^{2} \neq -1 \quad x \neq \pm 1
$$
$$
y-x^2 \geq 0 \quad y\geq x^{2}
$$

Defn: Level Curves for a function of 2 variables are the curves with equations y = k

Function of 3-Variables (independent)

$$
W = F(x,y,z)
$$

Where w is independent
