$$
r(t) = \left<  f(t),g(t), h(t)  \right> = f(t) \mathbf{i} + g(t) \mathbf{j} + h(k) \mathbf{k}
$$

$$
\lim_{  t \to a }  r(t) = \left<  \lim_{  t \to a } f(t)  , \lim_{  t \to a } g(t) \lim_{  t \to a } h(t) \right> 
$$=
$$
\left<  f(a) , g(a ), h(a) \right> 
$$
space curve
$$
\left\{ \begin{matrix}
x=f(t) \\
y = g(t) \\
z = h(t) \\
\end{matrix} \right\} 
$$
EX: what is the vector function
$$
\begin{matrix}
x= \cos t \\
y= \sin t \\
z = t \\
\end{matrix}
$$
this forms  a helix (oscillating in x and y as it progresses up in z)

U need arrows on vector function curves, always point the arrow in the direction of time 



EX2: 
Find the intersection of 
$$
x^{2} + y^{2} = 1 \text{ and } y + z =2
$$
as a space curve graph 


as soon as we see
$$
x^{2} + y^{2} = 1 \quad \text{(cylinder)}
$$
we know
$$
x(t) = \sin t,\quad y(t ), = \cos t, \quad z(t) = 2- \cos t 
$$

to find the intersection
$$
y+z =2 \quad \text{is a plane}
$$

the intersection of a cylinder and a plane is an ellipse 

upon graphing the cylinder and the plane we can find the ellipse crosses



Ex3: 

$$
\begin{matrix}
y = x^{2}  \quad \text{quad cylinder} \\
z = x^{3}  \quad \text{cubic cylinder}
\end{matrix}
$$
let x = t
$$
\left<  t,t^{2},t^{3} \right> 
$$
这是一个 “twisted cubic” he said this is too hard to draw using a mental image just plot points to figure it out
