RL environment, abstractly, 
	A system where there is a state, an agent, and a reward, the agent reads the state, acts on it, and that act gets rewarded or not depending on the state after the action.
		this can be many things, like an agent training loop, 

what is the verifiers library
	library to help with making RL envs
		define interactions btw model and environment, 
		 included GRPO trainer
