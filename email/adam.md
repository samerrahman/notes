what do i need to say to adam

 actually before this, try 100% correctness as a reward. 

[ what happened: ]
still no more than like +0.04

- I have implemented GRPO + 60% rm and 40% correctness. 
-  Currently, I'm finding that the performance is worse than just rest-EM (only around +0.04 from baseline)
- wondering whether there's a good reason that a reward model or GRPO would be any better, considering the fact that question answering in SQUAD is a fairly simple task.
